# Fourth Floor Challenge

- First I created a new repository and then I created a React App (which is the framework I am confident with).

## Plan the Near Earth App:

- Two entries (input or curtain of dates) for start and end.
- Of each object that comes back from that time frame:

* Name, Diameter, is it hazardous, sentry object?

- When the near earth object is clicked on, it should display its next 5 approaches and previous 5 approaches to earth

## Creating the App:

- I'm going to use Postman to see what information I get back with my API key

- I wrote a fetch request in the DatesEntry Component, and I am console.logging the data that I receive

- When looking at data by doing request in postman it only allows the time frame to be a maximum of 7 days. - Need to work on this
